A simple iOS app to see information on NH towns

This is my first publicly committed iOS application, mostly done as an exercise, 
but possibly of use to people interested in New Hampshire. It presents a list of
all the cities, towns, and townships in the state. Tapping one one brings up
some basic information and lets you view a map of the area. 

Current issues:
The list is very long, and the "Options" button isn't implemented yet. The
button should let you choose a subset by location or population.

Sometimes the first map you view is the South Atlantic instead of the town.
Backing up and trying again fixes it. I haven't figured out the reason for
this bug.

At this point I haven't put down the money to be a registered Apple developer,
so I've tested it only on the simulator.
